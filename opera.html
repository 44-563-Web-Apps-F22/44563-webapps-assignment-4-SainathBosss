                              <b>PHOEBE</b><br>               When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,<br> 
                              She wanders to and fro;<br> 
                         Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,<br> 
                         And to all questions she replies,<br> 
                              With a sad "Heigh-ho!"<br><br>  
                              <b>WILFRED</b><br>    Mistress Meryll!<br><br>  

                              <b>PHOEBE</b><br>     [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go<br> 
                                        away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.<br><br> 
                            
                              <b>WILFRED</b><br>    Haven't you anything to say to me?<br><br>  
                            
                              <b>PHOEBE</b><br>     Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all<br> 
                                        littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars<br> 
                                        in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently<br> 
                                        comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all<br> 
                                        ready for work? Ugh! you brute!<br><br>  
                            
                              <b>WILFRED</b><br>   These allusions to my professional duties are in<br> 
                                        doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because<br> 
                                        I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-<br> 
                                        tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We<br> 
                                        can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]<br> 
                                        Ah! you brought that upon yourself. </p>

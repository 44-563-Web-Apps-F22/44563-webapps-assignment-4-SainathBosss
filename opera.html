    <h6 class="ch1">PHOEBE</h6>
    <p class="song">When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
    She wanders to and fro;
    Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
    And to all questions she replies, 
    With a sad "Heigh-ho!"</p><br>

    <p class="speech">Mistress Meryll!</p><br>

    <h6 class="ch1">PHOEBE</h6>     
    <p class="speech">[looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
    away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.</p><br> 

    <h6 class="ch2">WILFRED</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Haven't you anything to say to me?</p><br>  

    <h6 class="ch1">PHOEBE</h6>    
    <p class="speech">Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
    littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars 
    in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently 
    comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all 
    ready for work? Ugh! you brute!</p><br> 

    <h6 class="ch2">WILFRED</h6>  
    <p class="speech">These allusions to my professional duties are in
    doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because 
    I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant- 
    tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We 
    can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
    Ah! you brought that upon yourself. </p>

    <h3>The Yeoman of the Guard</h3>
    <h5>Act I, Scene-Tower Green</h5>

    <p><i>Music by</i>
    <h6 class="direction">ARTHUR SULLIVAN</h6>
    <p>(First produced at the Savoy Theatre in London, England,
    on October 3, 1888.)</p>

    <h6 class="PHOEBE name ch1">PHOEBE</h6>
    <p class="song">When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
    She wanders to and fro;
    Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
    And to all questions she replies, 
    With a sad "Heigh-ho!"</p>

    <h6 class="WILFRED name ch2">WILFRED</h6>    
    <p class="speech">Mistress Meryll!</p>

    <h6 class="PHOEBE name ch1">PHOEBE</h6>     
    <p class="speech">[looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
    away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.</p>

    <h6 class="WILFRED name ch2">WILFRED</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Haven't you anything to say to me?</p>

    <h6 class="PHOEBE name ch1">PHOEBE</h6>    
    <p class="speech">Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
    littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars 
    in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently 
    comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all 
    ready for work? Ugh! you brute!</p> 

    <h6 class="WILFRED name ch2">WILFRED</h6>  
    <p class="speech">These allusions to my professional duties are in
    doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because 
    I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant- 
    tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We 
    can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
    Ah! you brought that upon yourself. </p>
